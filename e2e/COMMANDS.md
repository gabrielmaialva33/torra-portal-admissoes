# In another terminal, run tests in UI mode
pnpm playwright test --ui
```

### 2. Writing Tests

```bash
# Generate test with codegen
pnpm playwright codegen http://localhost:3000/onboarding/1

# Run new test in debug mode
pnpm playwright test e2e/my-new-test.spec.ts --debug
```

### 3. Verification

```bash
# Run affected tests
pnpm playwright test e2e/onboarding-flow.spec.ts

# Run in all browsers
pnpm playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox

# Check report
pnpm playwright show-report
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find process on port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change port in playwright.config.ts
```

### Timeout Errors

# Increase timeout
pnpm playwright test --timeout=120000

# Or in test file:
test.setTimeout(120000);
```

### Browser Not Installed

```bash
# Install all browsers
pnpm playwright install

# Install specific browser
pnpm playwright install chromium
```

### Clean State

```bash
# Clear Playwright cache
pnpm playwright install --force

# Remove test results
rm -rf test-results playwright-report

# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```
